HexToBin is a Windows console program that implements the following specification. Get the null-terminated wchar_t string of hexadecimal characters from the Windows clipboard. Starting with the first pair of characters in the string, convert each pair to a binary byte of data, and write the bytes to a buffer whose size is 4096 bytes. When the buffer is full, or the terminating null character is reached at the end of the string, write the contents of the buffer to a binary file in the current directory, named according to what the user entered at program startup, giving the filename the extension ".bin". Continue filling the buffer and writing bytes to the output file until the end of the hexadecimal character string is reached, or until encountering a character that is not a hexadecimal digit. When the entire hexadecimal string has been converted to binary data and written to the output file, close the output file, print to std::cout the number of bytes written to the output file, such as "5000 bytes written to output.bin" and on the next line, print "Enter any number to exit this program.", wait for the user to enter a number, then terminate the program.
  
HexToBin gets the clipboard string as CF_UNICODETEXT and outputs bytes in conventional order, meaning that 0x7B is converted to 01111011. When the generated binary file is opened in a hex editor, the binary data is displayed in the same hexadecimal order as the original hexadecimal string on the clipboard.
